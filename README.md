   # Let's Know Java

	Java's Features
  - Java is one of the most popular programming language in the world, improving continuously and getting new features always.
  - One of the most important feature is that Java is platform independent programming language. This means that if you develope your programme in         Windows, that programme can work in Linux or other operating system.
  - Java is fully object oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.
  - There are references which holds objects' informations. So there are no uses of pointers in Java. 
  - Java is multi-threaded. So it lets us to develop programmes to process jobs concurrently.
  - Thanks to platform independency, Java is portable.
  - Java handles memory management itself. It has automatic garbage collector to get rid of objects which are not being used by application anymore.
  
    	How is Java Working?
  - Java is a programming language which can be compiled and also interpreted. Java is being compiled and interpreted at the same time. 
    So the compile time is little longer but after compilation process, Java is faster than other programming languages. Because there is no need interpretation time anymore.
  - Compiler: The compiler converts source codes to machine code which machines can understand.
  - Interpreter: Converting to machine code and executing is at the same time. This is interpretation process what interpreter do.
    
	When a project is developed, the source codes are holded in .java files. Once the source codes are compiled by the compiler, they are converted to an intermediate format which name is "Bytecode". The sources which in bytecode format are kept in .class files. After that these bytecodes are interpreted by JVM (Java Virtual Machine). If the programme will be executed in Windows operating system, the JVM which is compatible to Windows are neded to be downloaded. This JVM interprete the Java programme and make it executable in Windows. Same process needed to be done in Linux or other operating systems. So the programme can be executable in any platform. These processes provide Java to be platform independent. 
	
	
        What is JDK, JRE and JVM?
  - JDK: JDK is a library package which contains lots of class and libraries and lets us to compile and execute the applications which is programmed by using Java. JDK involves JRE and extra additional packages. JDK can be defined a kind of SDK (Software Development Kit) but JDK supports only Java based development environments.
  - JRE: JRE is a software structure which is required to execute Java based software applications and applets. JRE takes place in JDK package.
  - JVM: JVM is a virtual machine that interprete bytecodes and make them compatible to which operating system execute the application. JVM is inside of JRE structure.
