	/*
	 * Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
	 * For example in real life, A person at the same time can have different characteristic. 
	 * Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person poses 
	 * different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
	 * Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 
	 * In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
	 */
	
	/*
	 * In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
		- Compile time Polymorphism
		- Runtime Polymorphism
		
		Compile-time polymorphism: It is also known as static polymorphism. 
			This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. 
			But Java doesnâ€™t support the Operator Overloading.
		
			Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters 
			then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in number 
			of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
		
		Runtime polymorphism: It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call 
			to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.

			Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member 
			functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
