	/*
	 * Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of
	 * declaring separate variables for each value. An array is a group of
	 * like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java
	 * work differently than they do in C/C++. 
	 * Following are some important points about Java arrays: 
	   - In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.(discussed below) 
	   - Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. 
	     This is different from C/C++ where we find length using sizeof. 
	   - A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type. 
	   - The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0. 
	   - Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable or a method parameter. 
	   - The size of an array must be specified by an int or short value and not long. 
	   - The direct superclass of an array type is Object. 
	   - Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable. 
	   - Array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) as well as object (or non-primitive) references
	     of a class depending on the definition of the array. In case of primitive
	     data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
	     In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment.

		 * can not assign 11th item to it. After declaring array1 variable, now we can
		 * give values to it by using indexes. In array which has n items, index begin
		 * from 0 and n-1. For example in array1, we have 10 items. So our indexes are:
		 * 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When we want to give value to first item we use
